 * towards a specified target object (e.g., the camera), but constrained to the
 * surface plane.
 *
 * This is useful for placing objects on walls or floors so they sit flat
 * against the surface but still turn to face the user.
 *
 * @param obj - The object to be placed and oriented.
 * @param intersection - The intersection data from a
 *     raycast,
 * containing the point and normal of the surface. The normal is assumed to be
 * in local space.
 * @param target - The object that `obj` should face (e.g., the
 *     camera).
 * @returns The modified `obj`.
